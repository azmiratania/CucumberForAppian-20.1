#Automated Testing With Cucumber For Appian

Cucumber For Appian is a client-side tool that builds on top of what FitNesse For Appian has implemented and allows users to write automated UI tests against Appian with Gherkin syntax. Cucumber For Appian will support all of the same methods that FitNesse For Appian currently supports.
